* **Modification:** The original texts have been structured into JSON format to enable interactive features. The Project Gutenberg license headers have been removed to facilitate the distribution of the raw content only.

## How to Use These Files
1. **Download** the `.json` file you want to explore (e.g., `homer-the-odyssey.json`).
2. **Upload** the file to an LLM of your choice (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, etc.).
3. **Prompt** the AI: *"run"*
4. **Interact:** The AI will adopt the specific persona and navigation rules defined in the file.
