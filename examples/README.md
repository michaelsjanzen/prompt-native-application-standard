# PNA Examples Library

This folder contains sample **Prompt-Native Applications (PNAs)**. These JSON files demonstrate how a static text can be converted into an interactive, persona-driven experience for Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Source Material & Copyright
All examples in this directory are derived from **Public Domain** works (published in the United States prior to 1929).
* **Legal Status:** These works were selected as examples because they are free of copyright restrictions.
* **Modification:** The original texts have been structured into JSON format to enable interactive features. The Project Gutenberg license headers have been removed to facilitate the distribution of the raw content only.

## How to Use These Files
1. **Download** the `.json` file you want to explore (e.g., `homer-the-odyssey.json`).
2. **Upload** the file to an LLM of your choice (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.).
3. **Prompt** the AI: *"run"*
4. **Interact:** The AI will adopt the specific persona and navigation rules defined in the file.
